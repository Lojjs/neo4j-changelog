        "body": "I came across a rather weird issue which seems to be some kind of race condition on indexing a property and I'd appreciate if you could first 
confirm if you can reproduce it, and then fix it and/or recommend a workaround.\r\n\r\n- Neo4j version: 3.0.1\r\n- Operating system: Windows 8.1\r\n- API/Driver: 
embedded GraphDatabaseService, but this happens also with in-memory instance used for tests\r\n\r\n- Steps to reproduce\r\nplease find the following code snippet 
that shows the problem (at least on my machine it fails virtually every time)\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/lilianaziolek/81b1adcdb2c9b3f1c0812952da51cfa9\r\nThe 
problem goes away if I either remove index (which results in a label-scan on search so obviously not a great idea) or introduce a sleep before the reading step. I 
tried adding the \"await for indexes\" as you can see, but that doesn't seem to help either.-It seems that after adding the nodes the index isn't updated on time 
but instead it's updated with an unknown (quite significant) delay.\r\n\r\n- Expected/actual behavior\r\nI would expect correct result of 3 nodes - either by 
using index or, in the worst case, a slower result from a scan. Instead I get back all the nodes unless I introduce a sleep.\r\n\r\nIf I missed some step that 
would enforce the update of the index please let me know - but I tried looking in the documentation and haven't found anything that would imply that anything 
special needs to be done for index to be updated within the writing transaction."
