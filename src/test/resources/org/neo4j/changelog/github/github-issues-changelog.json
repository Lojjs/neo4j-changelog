page locks and eviction.\r\n\r\nThis is solved by introducing a _cursor exception_ feature of the page cursors, whereby the decoding code can attach exceptions to 
the cursor during the decoding of records. We will then check for the presence of such an exception after it has been verified that the page access was 
consistent.\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduce a much more aggressive testing of inconsistent reads, by making the `AdversarialReadPageCursor` more devious: Instead of 
returning zeros to the reading code upon an injected inconsistent read, the adversarial cursor will instead count the operations performed upon it, and choose one 
at random. When that operation is later retried, the adversarial cursor will return random data from that point on. This allows more spectacular bugs to show up. 
These bugs are also fixed in this PR.\r\n\r\nCHANGELOG SUMMARY:\r\nFix rare record decoding exceptions caused by page reads racing with page writes to the same 
record, or page eviction."

implemented as a separate format, not plugged in by default,\r\nbut at least tested by RecordFormatTest. This commit also 
introduces\r\nInternalRecordFormatSelector which has a default (the current one) and ability\r\nto be configured to use any format by specifying RecordFormats
